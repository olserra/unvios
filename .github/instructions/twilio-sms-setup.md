## Quick Setup (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Get Twilio Credentials

1. Sign up at **[https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio)**
2. Get **$15 free credit** (≈750 SMS)
3. From the Twilio Console dashboard, copy:
   - **Account SID** (starts with `AC...`)
   - **Auth Token** (click "Show" to reveal)
4. Buy a **phone number** (free with trial)

### Step 2: Verify Your Test Number (Trial Only)

For trial accounts, verify recipient numbers:

1. Go to: **Phone Numbers** → **Verified Caller IDs**
2. Click **Add a new Caller ID**
3. Enter your test number (e.g., `+351914127195`)
4. Complete verification via SMS or voice call

### Step 3: Configure Environment

Add to `.env.local`:

```bash
# Twilio SMS Configuration
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890
```

### Step 4: Restart Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Step 5: Test

1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/sign-up` or `/dashboard/general`

## Development Without Twilio

**The system works without Twilio configured!**

If `TWILIO_*` variables are missing:
- ✅ Verification codes are logged to console
- ✅ Full functionality for development/testing
- ✅ Look for: `📱 SMS VERIFICATION CODE` in terminal

**Production requires real Twilio setup.**

- Add payment method
- No monthly fees, pay per SMS only

### 2. Enable International SMS
- Go to: **Settings** → **Geo Permissions**
- Enable countries you serve (e.g., Portugal, US)

### 3. Remove Trial Limitations
- Send to any number (not just verified)
- Remove trial message prefix
- Higher sending limits

### 4. Set Up Monitoring
- Configure usage alerts
- Set spending limits
- Monitor delivery rates

## Troubleshooting

### No SMS Received?

1. **Check console logs** for errors
2. **Verify phone format**: Must include country code (e.g., `+351914127195`)
3. **Trial accounts**: Recipient number must be verified first
4. **Check Twilio logs**: Console → Monitor → Logs → Messaging

### Environment Variables Not Working?

1. Ensure `.env.local` exists in project root
2. No quotes around values
3. Restart dev server after changes
4. Check for typos in variable names

### Authentication Error?

- Double-check Account SID and Auth Token
- No extra spaces in `.env.local`
- Make sure variables don't have quotes

## Implementation Details

**Files:**
- `lib/firebase-admin.ts` - `sendVerificationSMS()` function
- `app/api/user/mobile/route.ts` - API endpoint
- Database: `users` table with mobile verification fields

**Flow:**
1. User enters phone number
2. System generates 6-digit code
3. Code saved to DB with 10-minute expiration
4. SMS sent via Twilio (or logged to console)
5. User enters code to verify
6. Number marked as verified in database

**Security:**
- Codes expire after 10 minutes
- Rate limiting on verification attempts
- Phone numbers validated with E.164 format

2. Update `lib/firebase-admin.ts` implementation
3. Requires client-side Firebase SDK
4. See Firebase documentation for details
